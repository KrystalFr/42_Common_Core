# FactArena: Live Fake-News Fact-Checking Arena

## Description

FactArena is a multiplayer game about misinformation. Players join a room, then play five
short viral clips, one per server-controlled round. For each round, every player chooses
and confirms an individual virtual-credit stake (never real money), then answers "fact" or
"fake". The backend is authoritative for the game flow: it opens and closes each round,
resolves the result, advances the game and broadcasts the state over WebSocket. Every
player who chooses the correct answer wins and receives a payout based on their confirmed
bet, while players who choose the wrong answer lose their bet, while the persisted game
data also feeds leaderboards, match history and game dashboard.

One decision shaped the whole project: the verdict that decides who wins is a pre-labelled
answer key stored in the database, taken from a published fact-check. It never comes from
the LLM. The AI explains a verdict that is already known; it does not judge the game. That
is what keeps scoring deterministic and what makes the AI modules honest to demonstrate.

Key features:
- Multiplayer fact-checking rooms where players watch the same clips, place a separate virtual-credit bet for each round and vote fact or fake in real time
- Accounts with email/password or 42 OAuth login, JWT authentication, editable profiles, avatar uploads and protected REST/WebSocket access
- Player progression with virtual credits, experience points, achievements, leaderboard rankings, match history, statistics, and a game dashboard
- Friend search and requests, accepted friendships, online/in-game presence and one-click access to a friend's room
- Real-time room chat with model-based moderation, allowing, warning or hiding messages according to the moderation result
- Two AI-assisted services: a cited RAG assistant grounded in the fact-check corpus and a streaming free-form LLM chat surface
- A curated, source-traceable clip corpus with editorial truth labels, reveal explanations and the ability to report a problematic clip
- Responsive browser UI with embedded external videos, live presence, per-round betting, voting, progress, results and interactive analytics views

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose (v2). Everything (build included) happens inside the containers.
- The latest stable version of Google Chrome (v153).

### Run
```bash
git clone <repo-url> ft_transcendence && cd ft_transcendence
cp .env.example .env   # then edit the values
docker compose up --build # or make
```
The application is served by nginx at **https://localhost:8443**. The development certificate is
self-signed, so Chrome shows a warning: click *Advanced → Proceed*. This is expected.

The first build takes a few minutes (it installs every dependency and builds the SPA).
Once every service reports `healthy`, the stack is ready:

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| `https://localhost:8443/` | the SPA loads |
| `https://localhost:8443/api/health` | `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `docker compose ps` | 5 services, all `healthy` |

### Run (development, with hot reload)
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
Same URL, same nginx, same TLS, but the local code is mounted into the containers: saving a
file reloads the browser (React) or restarts the API (NestJS).
See `docker-compose.dev.yml` for the details.

> Only nginx publishes a port (8443 on the host, 443 inside). Every other service talks over the private Docker
> network, which is why `docker compose ps` shows no host ports for them; that is intended,
> not a bug.

### Useful commands
```bash
docker compose ps               # health of every service
docker compose logs -f backend  # follow one service's logs
docker compose down             # stop everything (keeps the database)
docker compose down -v          # stop AND wipe the database volume
```

## Team Information

| Login | Role(s) | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| `slario` | **Product Manager** | Docker Compose, nginx and TLS, meetings, deadlines, Gameplay designer, analytics across backend/Prisma/frontend |
| `alaroque` | **Back-end Core** | NestJS, auth, WebSockets, round state machine, credits, PostgreSQL |
| `elanteno` | **Tech Lead** | AI (Python)FastAPI, RAG corpus, LLM streaming, moderation, front/back integration |
| `krfranco` | **Product Owner** | Product vision, design system, page layouts, Tailwind theme |
| `oztozdem` | **Front-end Real-time & UX** | Room screen and its components: chat, betting panel, stats bar, reveal |

All members are **Developers**: they write code, review each other's PRs, test and document
their scope.

## Project Management

- **Work breakdown**: one scope per member (DevOps, back-end core, AI service, front-end real-time
  UI), each with its own long-lived branch, such as `DataAnalytics/Scynia_slario`,
  `DevOps/slario_Scynia`, `Ana_backend`, `feat/service-ia-rag-llm`, `Krystal_frontend`, `feat/frontend-tr`.
  The branch names in the repository are the actual record of who owned what.
- **Task tracking**: GitHub pull requests. Every merge into `main` went through a PR, which
  is also where disagreements were settled; PR #6 was reverted after it broke the stack on
  the school machines, and the ELK stack was removed by PR after it turned out `podman`
  cannot create containers using the `gelf` log driver.
- **Communication**: Discord, for daily coordination and for warning the owner of a scope
  before touching their files.
- **Code review**: at least one other member reviews a PR before it is merged.

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Reverse proxy | nginx | Single HTTPS/WSS entry point required by the subject |
| Frontend | React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS + Recharts | Imposed framework + valid CSS solution; fast SPA with interactive data visualization |
| Backend core | NestJS + Prisma | Structured framework for auth, WebSockets, game loop |
| AI microservice | FastAPI (Python) | Independent service, mature Python AI ecosystem |
| Database | PostgreSQL + pgvector | Reliable relational storage for users, rooms, games and credits, combined with vector search for the RAG corpus in the same database |
| Containers | Docker Compose | One-command deployment (subject requirement) |

### Why these choices

**Two backends instead of one.** The game logic (auth, rooms, credits, WebSocket state
machine) and the AI layer (embeddings, retrieval, LLM streaming) have nothing in common
except the database. Splitting them lets the AI service be written in Python, where the
ecosystem actually lives, while the game keeps NestJS's structure and typing. The front
never talks to the AI service directly: NestJS relays every call, so authentication and
rate limiting stay in one place.

**PostgreSQL with pgvector, not a separate vector database.** Adding a dedicated vector
store would mean a second database to deploy, back up and keep consistent. Pgvector keeps
the corpus passages next to the relational data, in one container. The boundary is
logical: Prisma owns the `public` schema, the AI service owns the `rag` schema; Prisma
handles the `vector` type poorly, so it never sees it.

**Mistral as the single AI provider.** One API key covers all three needs: embeddings
(`mistral-embed`, 1024 dimensions), streaming chat, and a model-based moderation endpoint.
The subject requires moderation to be decided by a model, not a word list, and Mistral
exposes exactly that. Being a French company processing data in the EU also keeps the
privacy policy simple.

**Deterministic answer key, never the LLM.** The verdict that decides who wins comes from
a pre-labelled editorial `truthLabel` stored in the database. The RAG/LLM layer only
*explains* a verdict that is already known. Scoring is reproducible, and a model
hallucination can never change a game's outcome.

**Embedded video, with the vote window synchronised rather than the picture.** A round is
a playlist of viral clips played in the platform's official iframe (YouTube or Facebook);
we host no video. The server only decides when each clip's vote opens and closes, the same
instant for every player, and that is the real-time part fairness depends on. Syncing the
frames themselves would cost a lot and prove nothing. The embed has to stay a pure iframe:
widgets from X, Instagram or TikTok run their JavaScript inside our origin and would charge
their console errors to us.

**Analytics are computed from the game ledger and events, not from a second analytics database.**
The Data & Analytics layer builds on the same PostgreSQL data already used by the game:
bets, votes, rounds and credit transactions. This keeps statistics consistent with the source
of truth used for gameplay and avoids duplicating financial or scoring state. Date filters are
resolved server-side, while React/Recharts turns the returned aggregates and histories into
interactive charts.

**Verdicts come from identified fact-checkers, never from us.** Every clip stores the
verdict published by AFP, Snopes, franceinfo or another signatory of the ClaimReview
standard, together with the article's URL. We never qualify a named person's words
ourselves: the fact-checker carries the editorial responsibility, and every verdict stays
traceable to a dated source. Ambiguous ratings are dropped rather than interpreted. The
rules the ingestion scripts follow are in `ai-service/app/rag/README.md`.

**An external LLM API rather than a self-hosted model.** One key in `.env`. A model served
from the FastAPI container would have removed the dependency, but would not fit in the
resources of a school machine.

## Database Schema

Sixteen relational models are managed by Prisma, plus one vector table owned by the AI service.

```
User ──1─N── Bet                  one stake per player per round
User ──1─N── ClipVote             one vote per player, round and claim
User ──1─N── Transaction           virtual-credit ledger
User ──1─N── Message               room chat messages
User ──1─N── AchievementUnlock     unlocked achievements
User ──1─N── ClipReport            reports submitted by a player
User ──N─N── User (via Friend)     friendship requests and friendships

Room ──1─1── Game                  the server-orchestrated game for the room
Room ──1─N── Round                 a room chains rounds
Game ──1─N── Round                 five rounds belong to the game
Room ──1─N── Message               messages belong to a room
Round ──1─N── Bet                  one bet per player in a round
Round ──1─N── ClipVote             votes submitted during a round
Round ──N─N── Claim                via RoundClaim, with playback order
Claim ──1─N── ClipVote             votes refer to the judged claim
Claim ──1─N── ClipReport            reports refer to a claim
Claim ──1─1── ClaimVerdict         AI explanation, display only
Room ──1─N── RoomPresence           connected socket presence
```

The 16 Prisma models are `User`, `AchievementUnlock`, `Friend`, `Message`,
`RoomPresence`, `Room`, `Round`, `Claim`, `RoundClaim`, `ClipReport`, `ClaimVerdict`,
`Bet`, `ClipVote` and `Transaction`. In addition to the relationships shown above:

- `AchievementUnlock` records achievements earned by a user.
- `ClipReport` records a user's report for a claim or clip.
- `Friend` represents a directed friendship request and stores either `PENDING` or
  `ACCEPTED` status.
- `RoomPresence` stores the socket, user, room and last-seen timestamp used for
  connection presence and reconnection handling.

Key fields. **Claim** carries `truthLabel` (TRUE/FALSE), the editorial answer key, plus
`mediaRef`, `videoEndS`, `sourceUrl` and `sourceKey` (unique, makes imports idempotent).
**Game** stores the current round index and overall status. **Round** moves through
`COUNTDOWN → OPEN → LOCKED → REVEALED → FINISHED`. **Bet** is unique per player and
round and records the stake, answer, confirmation, debit, result and payout timestamps.
**ClipVote** holds one `isFake` per claim, unique per `(user, round, claim)`.
**Transaction** records every credit movement with a `referenceId` that makes payouts
idempotent.

Separately, the AI service owns `rag.documents` (`source`, `title`, `url`, `content`,
`chunk_index`, `embedding vector(1024)`) with an HNSW cosine index.

## Features List

| Feature | Member(s) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Account & authentication | alaroque | Sign-up and sign-in by email and password (bcrypt, salted), plus 42 OAuth; JWT issued for both the REST API and the WebSocket |
| Live rooms | alaroque, slario | Create or join a room, see members appear and leave in real time, presence persisted server-side so a reconnection restores the player |
| Round state machine | alaroque, slario, elanteno | Server-authoritative `COUNTDOWN → OPEN → LOCKED → REVEALED → FINISHED`, driven by a 250 ms server loop that starts ready games, resolves expired rounds and advances the five-round game even with no client connected. A round also locks early as soon as every player who staked has judged the clip, so nobody waits out the timer once the round is complete. |
| Clip drafting | alaroque, elanteno | The server draws the round's clips itself, balanced at roughly 60 % false and excluding clips already played in that room |
| Per-round betting & voting | alaroque, slario, elanteno | Each player confirms one virtual-credit stake for the current round, then submits one FACT/FAKE answer for its clip while the round is open. |
| Per-round betting & scoring | slario, alaroque | Players confirm a bet for each round before submitting their FACT/FAKE answer; correct answers receive a payout based on the confirmed bet, while incorrect answers lose the bet |
| Advanced analytics dashboard | slario | Personal and room-level analytics derived from persisted game data, with predefined or custom date ranges, win rate, accuracy, category breakdowns, gains/losses, balance evolution, room player comparisons and export to CSV/PDF |
| Virtual credit ledger | alaroque | Every debit and payout is journalled with the resulting balance; payouts are idempotent |
| Room chat | oztozdem, alaroque | Send and receive messages in real time |
| AI moderation | elanteno, alaroque | Every message is judged by a model (not a word list) and allowed, flagged or hidden |
| Questionable AI bot | elanteno | `@bot` in the chat returns a sourced answer streamed token by token, and refuses to comment on clips from the round in progress |
| Sourced fact-check corpus | elanteno | 1 653 passages shipped with the repository, loaded on first start with their pre-computed vectors so the bot cites sources without any ingestion run: the ClaimReview records of published fact-checks, the full text of the 24 articles that established the verdict of the playable clips, and figures from INSEE, Eurostat and the World Bank. The ingestion scripts can grow it further. |
| Profile & stats | krfranco, alaroque, elanteno, slario | Profile page with win rate, rounds played and credit balance; display-name editing and avatar upload; match history listing each finished round with its date, room, opponents, stake and net gain; advanced analytics with date filters, charts and exports |
| Interactive data visualization | slario | Recharts-based line, bar, pie/donut, radar and composed charts integrated into the profile, room recap and friend-comparison views |
| Real-time analytics refresh | slario, alaroque, elanteno | WebSocket game events and server-side invalidation trigger fresh statistics after relevant round-resolution events while gameplay state remains synchronized in real time |
| Friends | elanteno | Search players by e-mail or display name, add and remove them, see who is online or in a game, and join their room in one click |
| Playable clip corpus | elanteno | 54 hand-curated clips with a playable video, 45 of them with their reveal explanation, all shipped in the seed. Clips whose video did not match the claim were reviewed in-game and dropped, as were war footage, partisan political content, and any subject requiring a content warning. |
| Responsive layout | krfranco, elanteno | Every page adapts from 320 px upwards: the multi-column grids stack, the navigation wraps, and the room's chat moves below the video. Verified with no element overflowing the viewport at 320, 390, 768 and 1024 px. |

### Module choices and justification

The modules were selected to cover the subject's required points while matching the
project's actual architecture and features. The table below gives the justification for
each choice and explains how it was implemented.

| Module | Why we chose it | How it was implemented |
|---|---|---|
| Framework frontend + backend | To build a structured full-stack application with the frameworks required or accepted by the subject. | React/Vite and Tailwind CSS power the frontend; NestJS and Prisma power the backend. |
| Real-time via WebSockets | Real-time synchronization is essential for a shared multiplayer round. | A JWT-authenticated Socket.IO gateway broadcasts room presence, bets, votes, chat messages and round transitions. |
| User interaction | To provide meaningful interaction beyond a static game interface. | Players use room chat, profiles, friends, presence indicators and live game controls. |
| Standard user management | To provide a complete user area rather than authentication alone. | The application supports profile editing, avatar uploads, display names, friends and online/in-game status. |
| Complete RAG system | The fact-checking topic requires answers grounded in reliable, traceable sources. | The AI service embeds documents, searches them with pgvector, generates grounded answers and returns citations. |
| LLM interface (streaming) | To demonstrate direct model interaction separately from the grounded RAG assistant. | Free-form questions are sent to Mistral and streamed back token by token through the backend and WebSocket layer. |
| Web-based game | A browser game is the project's central deliverable and demonstrates the required game mechanics. | Rooms, clips, betting, voting, server-side round progression, reveals and deterministic scoring are implemented in NestJS and React. |
| Multiplayer game (more than two players) | To prove that the game works fairly for several participants simultaneously, not only for two players. | Rooms support three or more players; the server synchronizes the round state and clock, validates each action and settles the pot atomically. |
| Backend as microservices | Separating game logic from AI responsibilities keeps services loosely coupled and independently maintainable. | NestJS handles authentication, game logic, WebSockets and persistence; FastAPI handles RAG, embeddings, LLM calls and moderation. They communicate through internal HTTP APIs. |
| ORM (Prisma) | To model relational game data safely and make migrations and transactions reproducible. | Prisma manages the PostgreSQL schema, migrations, typed queries and atomic settlement transactions. |
| OAuth 2.0 (42) | To offer an authentication method integrated with the 42 ecosystem in addition to local accounts. | Passport 42 handles the OAuth flow; the callback links or creates the user and issues the same JWT used by the application. |
| AI content moderation | The subject requires moderation based on a model rather than a static banned-word list. | Every chat message is sent to Mistral's moderation endpoint, then the backend applies the project's allow, warn or hide policy. |
| Game statistics & match history | Persistent statistics make the game meaningful beyond a single round and demonstrate relational queries. | The backend calculates wins, losses, rankings, accuracy, balances, experience and match history from bets, votes and transactions. |
| Data & Analytics | To turn the persisted game data into an interactive analytics feature rather than only basic statistics and history. | A dedicated NestJS statistics service exposes personal dashboards, round history, room statistics and friend comparisons. Prisma queries bets, votes, transactions, rounds and claims; React integrates period filters and Recharts visualizations, with CSV/PDF export from the analytics views. |
| Custom-made design | To have our own authentic design easily modifiable and easy to use, clean but practical. Not agressive for the eyes and a bit playful. | The custom design system was built using Tailwind CSS with a centralized color palette defined in index.css, reusable button component classes with built-in hover states and transitions, and custom icons stored in images and integrated throughout the application. |

### Detailed implementation notes

**Framework front + back.** React with Vite and Tailwind on the front, NestJS with Prisma
on the back, both explicitly accepted by the subject.

**Real-time via WebSockets.** A Socket.IO gateway authenticated by JWT, exposing nine
events (`room:join`, `bet:place`, `clip-vote:submit`, `chat:send`, `ai:chat`…) and
broadcasting round transitions. Presence is stored in the database rather than in memory,
so a reconnection restores the player into their room. Every state message carries the
server clock, which the client uses to correct its own drift; otherwise a player whose
machine runs ten seconds fast would vote in a shifted window.

**User interaction.** Room chat as the core deliverable, with profile and friends
alongside.

**Standard user management.** Profile editing, avatar upload, friends list and online
status, distinct from the basic authentication required by the subject.

**Complete RAG system.** Cosine search over pgvector, answers grounded in the retrieved
passages and citing their URL. The repository ships 1 653 passages with their pre-computed
vectors, so a freshly cloned installation answers with sources without running any ingestion.
The corpus mixes published fact-checks (AFP, Snopes, franceinfo, dpa…), including their
ClaimReview records and the full article text for the clips in play, with live official
indicators from INSEE, Eurostat and the World Bank.

When no retrieved passage covers the question, the assistant answers from its own knowledge
and says so, and the interface then shows no citation: the vector search always returns its
six nearest neighbours, relevant or not, and displaying unrelated sources under an answer
would suggest they support it.

**LLM interface.** Streaming generation from free user input, with retrieval switched off;
this is what makes it demonstrably distinct from the RAG surface, plus a server-side rate
limiter on top of the provider's own 429 handling.

**AI moderation.** Every chat message goes through Mistral's moderation endpoint; the
policy that turns categories into an action (allow, warn, delete) is ours and is the part
worth explaining.

**Web-based game.** The subject asks for four things and we can point at each. Players
play against each other: everyone in the room judges the same clip, confirms a bet for
the current round, and submits a FACT/FAKE answer. Every player who chooses the correct
answer wins and receives a payout based on their confirmed bet, while players who choose
the wrong answer lose their bet. Matches are live: the backend controls the complete round
lifecycle, holds the authoritative game state and automatically progresses through the five
rounds, while every client stays synchronized over WebSocket. The rules are explicit on
screen, and the win condition is deterministic, since it comes from the editorial answer
key rather than from a model. It is 2D, in the browser, with no plugin.

What makes it a Major rather than a UI is the server-side round machine: drawing a balanced
set of clips, a per-round betting window, a FACT/FAKE answer that is refused out of turn, an early lock
when every staked player has answered, then a settlement that pays the pot in one atomic
transaction.

**Multiplayer game (more than two players).** A room supports three or more players at the
same time. Everyone sees the same clip and the same round state, while each player submits
their own bet and votes independently. The server-authoritative state machine, server clock,
turn validation and atomic settlement provide fair gameplay and consistent results for all
participants. The module can be demonstrated directly on the website by opening a room with
multiple browser sessions and playing a complete round together.

**Backend as microservices.** The backend is split into two loosely coupled services with
clear responsibilities and HTTP interfaces. NestJS owns authentication, users, rooms,
game state, WebSockets, credits and persistence. FastAPI owns RAG retrieval, embeddings,
LLM streaming and AI moderation. NestJS is the authenticated gateway used by the frontend
and relays AI requests to FastAPI over internal HTTP; the frontend never calls the AI service
directly. Docker Compose runs the services independently, while nginx provides the single
HTTPS/WSS entry point.

**ORM (Prisma).** Prisma defines and generates the typed client for the PostgreSQL
schema. The backend uses Prisma migrations for reproducible database changes, typed
queries for users, rooms, rounds, bets, votes and credits, and interactive transactions
for the atomic end-of-round settlement.

**OAuth 2.0 (42).** Passport 42 handles the authorization flow and the callback validates
the provider response before linking or creating the local account. OAuth login is offered
in addition to, and never instead of, email/password authentication, and both methods issue
the same JWT used by the REST API and WebSocket gateway.

**Game statistics and match history.** The statistics service derives wins, losses,
accuracy, rankings, balances, experience and levels from persisted bets, votes and
transactions. The profile and statistics pages expose the player's finished rounds,
opponents, stakes, gains and progression, while the leaderboard aggregates results across
players.

**Data & Analytics** Data & Analytics was added later in the project's development as a separate
Major feature, extending the earlier statistics and match-history functionality rather than
replacing it. The feature is implemented across the NestJS backend, Prisma data layer and
React frontend.
The authenticated `/stats` API exposes the existing leaderboard and history endpoints as
well as the analytics endpoints for personal dashboards, user history, room statistics and
friend comparisons. `StatsService` derives the metrics from persisted game data instead of
maintaining a separate analytics store.
The personal dashboard supports predefined periods (`1m`, `3m`, `6m`, `1y`, `all`) and custom
`from`/`to` dates. It combines resolved bets, clip votes, transactions and resolved rounds to
calculate win rate, victories and defeats, total stakes and payouts, net gain, best and worst
results, overall accuracy, category accuracy and balance history.
Room analytics aggregate the participants, rounds, bets, votes, claims and transactions of a
room. They provide per-player performance, stake and payout information, accuracy, credit
evolution and round-level details. The comparison endpoint also validates that selected users
are accepted friends before returning comparable performance metrics.
The analytics interface is integrated into the existing application rather than exposed as a
standalone page. The profile dashboard provides period selection, personal KPIs, balance
evolution, accuracy by category and gain/loss visualizations. The room view adds player credit
evolution, cumulative accuracy and cumulative gains/losses to the final room recap. The friends
view can compare the current user with accepted friends.
Charts are implemented with Recharts and include line, bar, pie/donut, radar and composed
visualizations. The data displayed by the charts is loaded from the authenticated backend API
and refreshed after relevant server-side game events.
The analytics views provide **CSV and PDF export** for both personal dashboards and room
statistics. The exports use the same computed analytics data displayed by the application, so
the exported report follows the selected statistics rather than requiring a separate data
pipeline.

**Custom-made design**
Consist of:

7 CSS variables establish the visual language: noir-krystal #221f22, gris-krystal #2d2a2e, grisclair-krystal #403e41, bleu-d: #2563EB, bleu-l: #5C8AF0, red-d: #7D1811, red-l: #ED8179, and green tones from Tailwind's extended palette are layered for success states.

5 reusable button classes: .button-blue-d, .button-red-d, .button-blue-l, .button-green-l, .button-red-l - encapsulate styling logic. Each combines background colors, borders, hover states, and transitions into a single class.

4 classes vote/bourse: .premium-vote, .premium-vote-fact, .premium-vote-fake, .premium-bourse 

10 Custom icons (fact.gif, fake.gif, medal PNGs) were made and animated in procreate, are served from images and referenced by components via absolute paths (/images/...).

10 React components: Layout, Footer, Chat, ClipProgressBar, ResultReveal, StatsBar, VideoPlayer, ProtectedRoute, stats/Charts, stats/PeriodSelector

Montserrat font-family to provides clean modern typography.


## Individual Contributions

What follows can be checked against the git history. `git shortlog -sn origin/main` gives
the commit count per person; branch names and reverted pull requests prove the team work.
We stopped writing counts here because they went stale every week.

**`slario`, Production Manager, Data & Analytics.** Owns `docker-compose.yml`,
nginx and its TLS certificates, the container entrypoints, meetings and deadlines. Built the
complete ELK logging stack over two weeks, including Logstash, index retention, automatic
certificate generation and SSL between every component, then removed it by pull request once
we established that `podman`, which the school machines run, refuses to even *create* a
container declaring the `gelf` log driver. Also fixed two problems specific to the 42 machines:
the `chown` in the images fails on the school filesystem, and port 443 is privileged, so nginx
publishes 8443.
The later Data & Analytics work extends the project across the backend, Prisma data layer
and frontend. It adds the advanced analytics dashboard, period filtering, personal and room
statistics, friend comparisons, interactive visualizations and CSV/PDF exports. This work
was developed after the earlier game statistics and match-history functionality and is
documented as a separate Major module rather than replacing that historical contribution.

**`alaroque`, Back-end core.** Wrote essentially the whole NestJS application:
database schema and migrations, email/password authentication, 42 OAuth, the
server-authoritative game loop and the JWT-authenticated Socket.IO gateway, rooms and
presence, the betting module with server-side stake and balance validation, the atomic
settlement, the credit ledger, statistics and leaderboard, and the relay that keeps every AI
call behind NestJS so authentication and rate limiting stay in one place. Two commits are
explicit security-hardening passes after review. Also the person who merged most pull
requests into `main`. She also handled a substantial part of the project's debugging,
including investigating integration issues, fixing runtime errors and resolving problems
found during testing and code review.

**`elanteno`, Tech Lead / Architect, AI.** Built the FastAPI service: pgvector
schema and HNSW index, embeddings, retrieval, SSE streaming for the RAG and free-form LLM
surfaces, the moderation policy on top of Mistral, and the rate limiter. Assembled and
curated the game's content from the Google Fact Check Tools API, INSEE, Eurostat, the World
Bank and Wikipedia. Three problems shaped that work: Chrome dropped Theora in v123, silently
breaking every Wikimedia `.ogv` clip; Facebook embeds render `/videos/` but not `/posts/`;
and the corpus lived only in a local database, so a fresh clone had nothing to play; it is
now exported to the repository with its pre-computed vectors. On the front, wired the pages
to the real API and added the friends screen, the match history, the OAuth callback and the
responsive pass.

**`krfranco`, Front-end UI, Product Owner.** Owns the visual identity: the
Tailwind theme and colour tokens, the custom icons/gif, the shared layout, and the home, login, profile and lobby pages. Defined the component vocabulary, including the button classes, that every
screen added later reuses, which is why the friends page, the match history and the OAuth
callback needed no new styles. The visual pass was delivered before the API existed, with the
buttons left to be wired with the back-end.

**`oztozdem`, Front-end real-time and UX.** Built the room screen and its components from
the design mock-up: the chat panel with its per-author colouring and moderation badge, the
statistics bar, the results reveal and the video player. Also wrote `mocks/gameData.ts`, the
shared data shapes, which let the room UI be built and reviewed before the WebSocket contract
was settled.

That choice came at a price worth explaining. His branch `feat/frontend-tr` lived for weeks
and had to absorb `main` over and over, so `git shortlog` credits him with a single commit:
the merge squashed the rest. Two of his components, the betting panel and the clip progress
bar, were dropped when the round became server-driven and are no longer rendered. The lesson
we took from it is that a front-end branch should merge on the day the contract it depends on
is settled, not weeks later.

External services and data sources actually used:

- Mistral AI: embeddings (`mistral-embed`), streaming chat, moderation endpoint
- Google Fact Check Tools API: structured ClaimReview data feeding both the RAG corpus and
  the game's answer key
- INSEE (Banque de données macroéconomiques, SDMX): French national indicators
- Eurostat REST API: French and EU-wide indicators, used for comparative claims
- World Bank (World Development Indicators): international comparisons
- French Wikipedia: general-knowledge corpus

**AI usage.** We used AI (Claude Code) to help simplify and explain concepts that, even after reading documentation and
consulting peers, still seemed unclear or overly complex at first glance (for example, how Websocket works). No critical
logic or core implementation was copied from AI-generated outputs.
